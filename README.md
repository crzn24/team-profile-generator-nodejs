# Team Profile Generator Node.js

## Description
This project was a challenge assigned to us where we had to create a README generator using a small amount of starter code.

When you run the application in the Command-Line Interface, you are prompted with questions about the title of your project, the project description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, test instructions, license used, GitHub username, email address, and what you want to name the README file. This user input is filled into a README template.

In this challenge I had to use familiar but new syntax in JavaScript, especially some that looked like jQuery but was different. The overall logic made more sense than previous challenges but even with starter code, I had to think and Google a lot to find solutions to my errors. It was completely new to me working only in the CLI terminal. Not seeing what was wrong visually in a browser felt strange at first but eventually I got used to it. I had trouble figuring out how to write the new README file but eventually I found a solution. I was also unsure as to what licenses to include in my choices because there were so many options! I also did not know what the corresponding colors meant and was unable to find a good answer for which colors to use for a license and ended up just using green.


## Usage
This application generates a professional README when used in the Command Line. When entering node index.js in the CLI, you are immediately prompted with questions to fill in the README template. Its creation is a way to practice using the CLI, JavaScript, node, json packages, and dependecies.
